# PIdentity
The PIdentity program allows users to input the number of sides for a polygon. It then displays a circle, an inscribed polygon, and a circumscribed polygon, showing their respective areas. As users increase the side lengths, the areas of the polygons approach that of the circle, approximating pi as 3.14. Remarkably, the program can accurately calculate pi up to 6 decimal places when a side length of 10,0000 is used.
